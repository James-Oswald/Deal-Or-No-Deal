# Deal-Or-No-Deal
A unfinished snapshot of my Honors Programming Final Project, The game, Deal or no deal. Developed June 2016. 

This was the only snapshot I could find of my Honors Programming Final Project. A C++ GUI implmentation of deal or no deal using the lvp libraries. Someday I hope to find the finished copy.
